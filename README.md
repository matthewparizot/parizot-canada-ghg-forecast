As the climate crisis continues to worsen, with countries experiencing record high temperatures and increasing numbers of natural disasters, Canada has joined numerous other countries in proposing a ‘Net Zero’ commitment, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 40-45% from 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving close to zero GHG emissions by 2050. 

Making promises and keeping them, however, are two entirely different things. For Canada to meet these ambitious goals, it will need to make significant changes to reduce the impact of its biggest polluting industries, who are responsible for the majority of GHG emissions in this country. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act became law on June 29, 2021, and not much time has elapsed since then.

This project attempts to forecast future CO2 emissions based on figures from three decades of emissions data from the Canadian Government by building a recurrent neural network (RNN) to analyze the trends from the data and make predictions forwards to 2030, to see just how close Canada will be to achieving its goals, should current trends hold. Three different model types are used - SimpleRNN, LSTM and GRU - and compared to determine which is the most suitable for the dataset.
